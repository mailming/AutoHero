# Development Workflow

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, stable releases
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features, development base

### Feature Branches
- **`feature/feature-name`** - New features and enhancements
- **`bugfix/bug-name`** - Bug fixes and patches
- **`hotfix/issue-name`** - Critical fixes for production

## Development Workflow

### 1. Starting New Work
```bash
# Always start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Development Process
```bash
# Make your changes
# Commit frequently with descriptive messages
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description of changes"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Integration
```bash
# Merge feature into develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin develop

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Release Process
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/version-number

# Make final adjustments, update version numbers
# Merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge release/version-number
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

## Current Status

### Active Branches
