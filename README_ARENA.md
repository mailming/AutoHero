## Configuration

### Team Selection Strategy
- **Current Team First**: Uses your default arena/grand arena team
- **Alternative Teams**: Top 5 heroes by power if current team fails
- **Win Rate Threshold**: Minimum 30% win probability to attack
- **Skip Unwinnable**: Avoid opponents with no winning team

### Opponent Selection Strategy
- **Power Ratio**: Calculate `opponent.power / your.power`
- **Rank Priority**: Lower rank = easier opponent
- **Difficulty Score**: `powerRatio + (rank / 1000000)`
- **Sort Order**: Easiest opponents first

## API Integration

- `arenaGetInfo` / `grandGetInfo` - Get arena status and opponents
- `arenaStartBattle` / `grandStartBattle` - Start battles
- `arenaEndBattle` / `grandEndBattle` - Complete battles
- `teamGetAll`, `teamGetFavor`, `heroGetAll` - Team data

## Error Handling
